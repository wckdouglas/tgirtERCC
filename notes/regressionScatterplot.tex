\noindent For a gene $i$, suppose \newline
\[
1. Expression_{A} = x_i
\]
\[
2. Expression_{B} = y_i
\]
fold change (FC) between sample AB will be
\[
FC^{AB}_i = \frac{x_i}{y_i} = \pi^{(1)}_i
\]
\[
x_i = \pi^{(1)}_i y_i
\]
if true mix ratio is 3:1, and fold change of CD of gene $i$ will be
\[
FC^{CD}_{i} = \frac{3x_i + y_i}{3y_i+x_i} = \frac{3\pi^{(1)}_i y_i + y_i}{3y_i + \pi^{(1)}_i y_i}  = \frac{3\pi^{(1)}_i + 1}{3 + \pi^{(1)}_i } = \pi^{(2)}_i
\]
But mix ratio might not be exactly 3 and with simply assuming that is exactly 3 will affect the standard error. We have to use regressions to estimate the true mix ratio in samples, since we know $\pi^{(1)}_i$ and $\pi^{(2)}_i$ for every genes from our data, it is just a linear regression.
Substituting theoretical mix ratio 3 by true mix ratio $\alpha$,
\[
\frac{\alpha_i\pi^{(1)}_i + 1}{\alpha_i + \pi^{(1)}_i} = \pi^{(2)}_i
\]
For all genes,
\[
\frac{\alpha\pi^{(1)} + 1}{\alpha + \pi^{(1)}} = \pi^{(2)}
\]
\[
a(\pi^{(1)}-\pi^{(2)}) + 1 = \pi^{(1)}\pi^{(2)}
\]
This is the same format as
\[
ax + b + \epsilon= y
\]
where $x = \pi^{(1)} - \pi^{(2)}$, $y = \pi^{(1)}\pi^{(2)}$ and $\epsilon$ is the error term we are comparing between TGIRT-seq and TruSeq3. The predicted $FC^{CD}$ would be
\[
\pi^{(2)}_{predicted} = \frac{a\pi^{(1)} + 1}{a + \pi^{(1)}}
\]
and $R^2$ can be computed as
\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i}(\pi^{(2)}_{predicted} - \pi^{(2)}_i)^2}{\sum_{i}(\pi_i^{(2)} - \bar{\pi}^{(2)})^2}= 1 - \frac{\sum_{i}\epsilon_i^2}{\sum_{i}(\pi_i^{(2)} - \bar{\pi}^{(2)})^2}
\]
